English translation
Black shadow

Versions: #1#2
When I think you left
Black shadow you amaze me
At the foot of my pillow
You turn back and mock me.

When I imagine you’ve left
Even in the sun you show yourself to me
And you’re the star that shines
And you’re the wind that blows.

If they sing, you are who is singing
If they cry, you are who is crying
And you are the murmur of the river
And you are the night and the dawn.

You’re in everything, and you are everything
To me and inside of me you do live (dwell)
And you’re never going to leave me
Shadow you always amaze me.
